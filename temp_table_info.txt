table: node_utilization_metrics
description: The node_utilization_metrics table captures channel-wise utilization and interference information from Access Points (APs) every 15 minutes. It provides channel utilization data on a per-AP, per-channel basis, combining measurement data from both on-channel and off-channel survey reports. This is useful for understanding Wi-Fi channel congestion and interference at a granular level.
documentation: The table is stored in S3 as Parquet files and is updated every 15 minutes.
It is part of the Plume Data Warehouse schema and is used for analytics and monitoring of Wi-Fi network health and performance.
The data is partitioned by time and other relevant fields for efficient querying (e.g., by location, node, channel, and time).
The table is referenced in multiple internal documentation sources for both engineering and partner data exports

table: location_coverage_alarm_status
Description:
The location_coverage_alarm_status table provides daily, per-location information on Wi-Fi coverage alarms. It indicates whether a location was in a pod coverage alarm (issues with Plume Pods) or a client device coverage alarm (issues with client devices) by aggregating the alarm status of all pods and client devices at that location for each day. This aggregation helps identify locations experiencing Wi-Fi coverage issues, either due to poor pod placement or client device connectivity problems. Locations with only gateways (Ethernet-connected) do not report pod coverage alarms, as gateways alone cannot have Wi-Fi coverage issues 
Documentation:
The table is stored as Parquet files in S3 and is updated daily.
It is part of the Plume Data Warehouse schema and is used for analytics, monitoring, and reporting on Wi-Fi coverage health at the location level.
The data is partitioned by date and other relevant fields for efficient querying (e.g., by location, date).
The table is referenced in internal documentation for engineering, partner exports, and customer support use cases 
Used as a source for summary and chronic alarm analytics
