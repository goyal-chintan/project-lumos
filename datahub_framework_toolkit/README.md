# DataHub Framework Toolkit

This toolkit provides a modular ingestion and metadata management framework for DataHub, supporting multiple data sources and pipelines.

## Structure

- `configs/`: Global and team-specific configuration files.
- `core_library/`: Core logic for ingestion, enrichment, lineage, RBAC, profiling, DQ, and extraction.
- `sample_configs_and_templates/`: Example YAML templates for ingestion, enrichment, and lineage.
- `orchestration_examples/`: Example DAGs for orchestration (e.g., Airflow).
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.

See subdirectories for details.
